What is Nanocut?
================

Nanocut is a program designed to cut out various objects from three dimensional
crystal structures. It is aimed to be helpful when creating geometry input for
atomistic simulations. Currently it can create following objects:

* Spherical cluster
* Polyhedral cluster
* Cylindrical cluster
* Spherical wire (1D periodic)
* Polyhedral wire (1D periodic)
* Plain slab (2D periodic)
* Supercells (3D periodic)

See [the documentation](http://aradi.bitbucket.org/nanocut/) for more details.

The program is available under the 2-clause BSD license. It is an open
source project, so feel free to [join
it](http://bitbucket.org/aradi/nanocut); especially if you think that
some additional features are needed or something could be implemented
in a more user friendly way. If you find the program useful, please
recommend it to others who may be also interested in using it.
