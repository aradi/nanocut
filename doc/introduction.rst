What is Nanocut?
================

Nanocut is a program designed to cut out various objects from three dimensional
crystal structures. It is aimed to be helpful when creating geometry input for
atomistic simulations. Currently it can create following objects:

* Spherical cluster
* Polyhedral cluster
* Cylindrical cluster
* Spherical wire (1D periodic)
* Polyhedral wire (1D periodic)
* Plain slab (2D periodic)
* Supercells (3D periodic)

The program is available under the 2-clause BSD license (see
:ref:`sec-license`). It is an open source project, so feel free to join it, if
you think that some additional features are needed or something could be
implemented in a more user friendly way. The project is currently hosted under

 `http://bitbucket.org/aradi/nanocut <http://bitbucket.org/aradi/nanocut>`_

If you find the program useful, please recommend it to others who may be also
interested to use it.
